# Taylor Swift Concert Setlist Scores 
Back in June of 2023, my wife took me (maybe dragged me is a better term?) to a Taylor Swift Eras Tour concert in Kansas City, MO. It ended up being an amazing experience and I'm a low-key Swiftie now. Despite all the fun I was having, I also decided this was a great opportunity to collect some data in the form of a number indicating how much I liked each song in the setlist. After showing my wife what I was doing once we got home, she gave me scores for each of the songs in the setlist as well.

This fun analysis utilizes Python and features the Pandas and Plotly libraries. I really enjoyed putting this quick analysis together and I hope you enjoy looking as well. Data is everywhere!
